## 🔄 How It Works

### User Journey:

```
1. User logs in via login.html
   ↓
2. localStorage.currentUser = username
   localStorage.userData = {username: {...user stats...}}
   ↓
3. User can now navigate to:
   - Challenge page (index.html) → Updates userData
   - Profile page (profile.html) → Reads userData & displays stats
   - Review page (review.html) → Shows learned words from userData
   - Word List (wordlist.html) → Shows word status from userData
   ↓
4. Each page reads the same localStorage data
   ↓
5. All pages stay synchronized automatically
```

## 📊 Data Structure (localStorage)

### Keys Created/Used:
- **currentUser** (String): Username of logged-in user
- **userData** (JSON): All user profiles and their statistics

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Current Implementation:
- ⚠️ Passwords stored in plaintext (localStorage)
- ⚠️ No server-side validation
- ⚠️ No encryption of sensitive data

### Recommendations for Production:
1. Hash passwords (never store plaintext)
2. Implement server-side backend
3. Use HTTPS for data transmission
4. Implement session tokens
5. Add CSRF protection
6. Validate all input data

## 🎓 Architecture Overview

### Three-Tier System:
1. **Authentication Tier** (login.html)
   - Creates user account
   - Stores credentials
   - Sets currentUser
   
2. **Data Tier** (localStorage)
   - Stores user profiles
   - Stores user statistics
   - Persists across sessions
   
3. **Presentation Tier** (All HTML pages)
   - Reads from localStorage
   - Displays data
   - Updates userData (challenge page)

---

## 🔗 File Dependencies

### Critical Files:
- **data.json** - Must be in root folder
- **script.js** - Updates user statistics
- **localStorage** - Persists user data

### All Pages Need:
- style.css (global styling)
- nav.css (navigation styling)
- Page-specific CSS files

---
