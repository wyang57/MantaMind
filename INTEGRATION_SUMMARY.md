    "inProgressWords": ["word3", "word4", ...],

    },

## Feature Integration Points

   - Unstoppable: 10+ word streak
   - Halfway There: 50% completion
   - Vocabulary Master: 75% completion (Master rank)

### Review Page
1. **Shows only user's words**:
   - Combines learnedWords + inProgressWords
   - Fetches full word data for display

2. **Prevents unauthorized access**:
   - Redirects if not logged in
   - Shows error message if no words to review

### Word List Page
