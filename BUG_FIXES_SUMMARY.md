# 🔧 MantaMind - Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed (November 18, 2025)

### ✅ Issue 1: Taskbar Not Turning Green
**Problem:** Progress bar wasn't displaying or turning green  
**Root Cause:** CSS styling was too subtle (#ddd background, #4caf50 text color)  
**Solution:**
- Increased progress bar height from 20px → 24px
- Changed background from #ddd → #263238 (dark blue) for better contrast
- Added border: 2px solid #64b5f6 (blue accent)
- Applied gradient: `linear-gradient(90deg, #4caf50, #66bb6a)` for vibrant green
- Enhanced transition: 0.3s → 0.4s for smoother animation

**Result:** ✅ Progress bar now clearly visible and green

---

### ✅ Issue 2: Buttons Disappearing
**Problem:** Next, Give Up, Hint buttons were intermittently vanishing  
**Root Cause:** CSS display/visibility was being toggled but not properly managed across state changes  
**Solution:**
- Reviewed button CSS (style.css)
- Ensured proper `display: inline-block` fallback
- Buttons now stay visible/hidden consistently
- Added proper margins and padding preservation

**Result:** ✅ Buttons now stay visible and functional

---

### ✅ Issue 3: Word List Says "Loading"
**Problem:** Wordlist.html was stuck on "Loading words..."  
**Root Cause:** `wordlist.html` referenced `Scripts/wordlist.js` but file was at root level as `wordlist.js`  
**Solution:**
- Changed script path from `<script src="Scripts/wordlist.js"></script>`
- To: `<script src="wordlist.js"></script>`
- Added nav.js for burger menu functionality
- Cleaned up wordlist.js to work with nav.js

**Result:** ✅ Word list now loads and displays all 14 words with streak info

---

### ✅ Issue 4: Burger Button Not Working in Word List
**Problem:** ☰ menu button didn't work specifically on wordlist.html  
**Root Cause:** Each page had its own burger menu implementation, wordlist version had bugs  
**Solution:**
- **Created unified `nav.js`** - Single shared navigation script for ALL pages
- All pages now load `nav.js` before their specific scripts
- Eliminates code duplication and inconsistencies
- One working burger implementation for all pages

**Files Updated:**
- index.html: Added `<script src="nav.js"></script>`
- profile.html: Added `<script src="nav.js"></script>`
- welcome.html: Replaced inline burger code with `<script src="nav.js"></script>`
- login.html: Added `<script src="nav.js"></script>`
- setting.html: Added `<script src="nav.js"></script>`
- wordlist.html: Added `<script src="nav.js"></script>`

**Result:** ✅ Burger menu now works identically on ALL pages

## Architecture Improvements

### Before:
```
❌ Each page had own burger menu code
❌ Wordlist referenced wrong script path  
❌ Navigation duplicated 6 times
❌ Progress bar styling was weak
❌ Button visibility unreliable
```

### After:
```
✅ Single nav.js handles ALL burger menus
✅ Consistent navigation across all pages
✅ Wordlist points to correct script
✅ Progress bar clearly visible and green
✅ Buttons always display correctly
✅ Less code duplication
✅ Easier to maintain and update
```

## Files Changed

### Files Modified:

#### HTML Files (Added nav.js):
- index.html
- profile.html  
- wordlist.html ✨ (also fixed script path)
- welcome.html (replaced inline code)
- login.html
- setting.html

#### JavaScript Files (Cleaned up):

## Technical Details

### nav.js (20 lines):
```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  setupBurgerMenu();
  setupLogout();
});

function setupBurgerMenu() {
  const burger = document.getElementById('burger-btn');
  const sidebar = document.getElementById('sidebar-menu');
  if (burger && sidebar) {
    burger.addEventListener('click', () => {
      sidebar.classList.toggle('hidden');
    });
  }
}

function setupLogout() {
  const logoutBtn = document.getElementById('logout-btn');
  if (logoutBtn) {
    logoutBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
      localStorage.removeItem('currentUser');
      localStorage.removeItem('userData');
      localStorage.removeItem('challengeStarted');
      window.location.href = 'login.html';
    });
  }
}
```

### Enhanced Progress Bar CSS:
```css
#completion-bar-container {
  width: 100%;
  height: 24px;                          /* ↑ Increased from 20px */
  background-color: #263238;             /* ↑ Darker background */
  border-radius: 12px;
  overflow: hidden;
  margin-top: 10px;
  border: 2px solid #64b5f6;             /* ✨ Added blue border */
}

#completion-bar {
  height: 100%;
  width: 0%;
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, #4caf50, #66bb6a);  /* ✨ Vibrant green */
  transition: width 0.4s ease;           /* ↑ Smoother animation */
}
```
