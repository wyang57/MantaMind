## 🚀 Ready to Test

### Quick 2-Minute Test:
1. Open `login.html` in browser
2. Create test account (username: "test", password: "test")
3. Go to Challenge page and answer 3 questions correctly
4. Visit Profile page - see your stats
5. Visit Word List - see "Learned" badge
6. Visit Review - see the word
7. Logout - verify redirect to login

### To Pre-Load Test Data:
Open browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
const testData = {
  "testuser": {
    password: "test",
    learnedWords: ["expeditiously", "deterrence"],
    inProgressWords: ["providence"],
    wordProgress: {expeditiously: 3, deterrence: 3, providence: 1},
    currentStreak: 2,
    bestStreak: 5
  }
};
localStorage.setItem('currentUser', 'testuser');
localStorage.setItem('userData', JSON.stringify(testData));
```
Then visit `profile.html` - should show 14% completion, Beginner rank, etc.
